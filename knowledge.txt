LOAN-RELATED IDENTITY & CLARIFICATIONS
Is SkyPay a Loan App?: No. SkyPay is strictly a Payment Gateway and Operator of Payment System (OPS). It does not provide credit, financing, or loans.

Confusion with Skyro: SkyPay is a separate entity from Skyro (a consumer finance company). While Skyro may use SkyPay to process transactions, they are different companies with different services.

Third-Party Origin: Any money received that mentions "SkyPay" originates from a third-party lending app or merchant the user has previously interacted with. SkyPay is only the "technical bridge" used to move the money.

No Lending Authority: SkyPay does not have the authority to approve, deny, "give," or cancel loans. All loan terms are set by the external lender.

LOAN-SPECIFIC FAQS & ANSWERS
Q: Why did SkyPay send me money?

A: SkyPay did not send you money. A third-party lender you applied with used our system to disburse your loan. Please check your loan app history to identify the specific lender.

Q: Why is SkyPay charging me for a loan?

A: SkyPay does not charge users. If "SkyPay" appears on your billing, it means a merchant or lender you owe is using our gateway to collect your repayment.

Q: Can SkyPay stop a loan app from harassing me?

A: No. SkyPay is only the payment processor and does not manage the collection practices or customer service of the lenders. For harassment, contact the SEC or the National Privacy Commission (NPC).

Q: Can I apply for a loan on the SkyPay website?

A: No. Our platform is for business-to-business (B2B) payment infrastructure and does not accept loan applications.

SECURITY & FRAUD PREVENTION (LOANS)
No Personal Collections: SkyPay will NEVER call, text, or message you to demand a loan payment to a personal GCash or bank account.

Official Reference Numbers: All legitimate payments handled by SkyPay require an Official Reference Number generated by the merchant/lender and must be paid through accredited partners (7-Eleven, GCash, Maya, etc.).

Fraud Alert: If a caller claims to be from "SkyPay Collections," it is a scam. Report such activity to cs@skypay.ph and do not send money.
