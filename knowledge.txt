### COMMON DEFINITIONS & GUIDANCE
Late Check: A payment marked as "late check" means the payment was completed after the official due date[cite: 407, 433].
Why did I receive a notice?: A merchant or lender used SkyPay’s system to process your transaction[cite: 434].
Support Guidance: For API or integration issues, contact the QA Team or Integration Team[cite: 405, 435].
Support Guidance: For payment-related concerns, contact official SkyPay support channels[cite: 406, 435].
Important Note: Any money collected via SkyPay for loans originates from third-party loaning apps/companies, not from SkyPay itself[cite: 420, 445].

### IMPORTANT NOTE ON SUDDEN FUNDS
If a user receives money suddenly in their account and SkyPay is mentioned, it is NOT money given by SkyPay[cite: 420, 444]. 
SkyPay is only the technology bridge used to facilitate the transfer[cite: 401, 418]. 
The funds actually originate from a third-party loaning app or company that the user previously clicked on or used.
SkyPay does not issue loans and does not have the authority to "give" money to individuals directly[cite: 402, 414].

### COMMON DEFINITIONS & FAQS
...
- Why did I receive money/notice suddenly?: This means a third-party merchant or lender you used processed a transaction through SkyPay's system[cite: 434].
- Did SkyPay give me a loan?: No, the loan comes from a separate lending company; SkyPay only handles the payment routing[cite: 431, 445].
